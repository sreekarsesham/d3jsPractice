d3.select() and d3.selectAll()
------------------------------

d3.select() it is similar to getElementByID. It will get only the 1st element of specified tag where as d3.selectAll() will get all the elements with sepecified tags.For example see code "domSelection.html"
--> this should be written in <script> tag
--> we can select by using name or id or class
--> using d3.select() and d3.selectAll() we can also select nested items such as all <td>s or 1 <tr>
